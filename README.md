  <h1>House Price Prediction Project</h1>

  <p>This project is a data science project that aims to create a machine learning model to predict the selling price of a house based on various factors such as location, size, condition, etc.</p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Python libraries Numpy and Pandas are used for data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Matplotlib is utilized for visualizing the data to gain insights and understand the relationships between different variables.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Building:</strong> Scikit-learn (sklearn) is employed for building machine learning models to predict house prices based on the available data.</li>
    <li><strong>Development Tools:</strong> Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm are used as integrated development environments (IDEs) for coding and experimentation.</li>
    <li><strong>HTTP Server:</strong> Python Flask is used to create an HTTP server for serving the machine learning model.</li>
    <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to develop the user interface (UI) for interacting with the prediction model.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technologies and Tools Used</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Python: Programming language used for data analysis, modeling, and server-side scripting.</li>
    <li>Numpy and Pandas: Python libraries for data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.</li>
    <li>Matplotlib: Plotting library for creating visualizations of data.</li>
    <li>Scikit-learn (sklearn): Python machine learning library for building predictive models.</li>
    <li>Jupyter Notebook: Interactive notebook environment for data analysis and experimentation.</li>
    <li>Visual Studio Code and PyCharm: Integrated development environments (IDEs) for coding and project management.</li>
    <li>Python Flask: Micro web framework for building web applications and HTTP servers.</li>
    <li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Front-end web technologies for developing user interfaces.</li>
  </ul>
